Requirements:
SNMPTT (tested with version 1.2 & 1.3)
A web server (install script assumes Apache)
mod_wsgi
Python (tested with 2.4, 2.6 and 2.7)
Django (tested with version 1.2.X and 1.3)
django-piston (the experimental api is based on piston)
A database (install script assumes PostgreSQL)
psycopg2 (for python postgresql support)
Net-SNMP

PostgreSQL notes:
8.1 seems to be quite slow, 8.4 is much better.

Apache notes:
Apache can hang if mod_python is loaded at the same time as mod_wsgi. Therefor, make sure mod_python is not loaded if it is installed.

General notes:
An easy way to install the python requirements is by using easy_install or pip. 

How to install:
IMPORTANT!!! DO NOT CREATE A DATABASE WHEN INSTALLING SNMPTT. THE INSTALL SCRIPT FOR SNAKETRAP WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT!
Install requirements
Install and set up your database (check http://www.postgresql.org for more information)
edit install.cfg
./install.sh (follow the instructions)
Finish by configuring snmptt with the same database settings as the ones you specified during installation.
If you forgot your settings, they can be found in <site_dir>/settings.py (default: /usr/share/snaketrap/settings.py)

Notes about plugins (actions):
There are a few plugins bundled with SnakeTrap that can be used. Most need to be configured before they are used. Take a look at them 
in your action_dir (default /var/snaketrap/actions) for information on how to configure them.

Troubleshooting:
Make sure you've configured snmptt correctly, check your system logs if something is not working correctly or no traps are received.
Also make sure that snmptrapd is running correctly.
Obviously you need to make sure that some device is configured to send snmp traps to you :)
SnakeTrap errors will be logged to your web server logs so be sure to check them for any information.
You can turn on Django debugging by setting DEBUG = True in settings.py (not recommended for production)
If you're running SELinux, be sure to check if there are any denials and fix them. Not a lot of testing has been done with SELinux
so be sure to report any bugs you may find to the above mentioned email address.
