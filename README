Requirements:
SNMPTT (tested with version 1.2 & 1.3)
A web server (install script assumes Apache)
mod_wsgi
Python (tested with 2.4, 2.6 and 2.7)
Django (tested with version 1.2.3 and 1.2.4)
django-piston
A database (install script assumes PostgreSQL)
psycopg2 (for python postgresql support)
Net-SNMP

How to install:
IMPORTANT!!! DO NOT CREATE A DATABASE WHEN INSTALLING SNMPTT. THE INSTALL SCRIPT FOR SNAKETRAP WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT!
Install requirements
Install and set up your database (check http://www.postgresql.org for more information)
edit install.cfg
./install.sh (follow the instructions)
Finish by configuring snmptt with the same database settings as the ones you specified during installation.
If you forgot your settings, they can be found in <site_dir>/settings.py (default: /usr/share/snaketrap/settings.py)

Troubleshooting:
Make sure you've configured snmptt correctly, check your system logs if something is not working correctly or no traps are received. 
Also make sure that snmptrapd is running correctly.
SnakeTrap errors will be logged to your web server logs so be sure to check them for any information.
You can turn on Django debugging by setting DEBUG = True in settings.py (not recommended for production)
If you're running SELinux, be sure to check if there are any denials and fix them. Not a lot of testing has been done with SELinux
so be sure to report any bugs you may find to the above mentioned email address.
